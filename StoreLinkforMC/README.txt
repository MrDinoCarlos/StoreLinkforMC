== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Does this plugin connect directly to Minecraft? =
No. It exposes a secure REST API endpoint that your Minecraft server connects to for fetching pending deliveries.

= Is there a Pro version? =
Yes. The free version supports up to 3 product mappings. The Pro version offers unlimited mappings and additional integrations.

= Does it work with LiteSpeed Cache or WP Rocket? =
Yes. You should exclude the API routes `/wp-json/storelinkformc/v1/*` from caching. This ensures fresh data is always returned.

= Can I manage deliveries manually? =
Yes. Use the **Deliveries** admin page to edit, delete or reassign items per player.

== Debugging & Tools ==

The **Settings** page provides:

- üß™ View current DB table structure.
- ‚ôªÔ∏è Rebuild the `pending_deliveries` table.
- üîë Regenerate API token.
- üßπ Flush WordPress object cache.
- üõ† Access recommendation for WP phpMyAdmin or Adminer for deeper inspection.
